My all time favourite Chocolate Chip Cookies. These amazing cookies are made using melted butter, so they're extra soft and chewy, with crispy edges and plenty of chocolate chips. Honestly, i'd take these Chocolate Chip Cookies over almost ANY other dessert.



2 1/4 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup butter, softened 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup packed brown sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla essence 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
